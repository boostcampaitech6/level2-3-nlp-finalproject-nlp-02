Your question is, my free time with not exercising, right?
You know, Eva, I don't like exercise, so my time is always not exercising.
So, I will tell you about my free time.
On weekdays, Usually I study my major.
You know, my major is computer science, so I usually study on my computer.
And after study, I watch YouTube on my computer or I listen to music in my bed.
That's what I do most of my time.
On weekends, I go to the.
I always go to the park near my home.
Because I never exercise on weekdays.
Get about five minutes of food from my home.
So, I can easily go to the park and when I want to go to the park, I just go outside.
